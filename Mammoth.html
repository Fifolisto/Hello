<p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&lt;Head&gt;The <b>woolly mammoth</b> (<i>Mammuthus primigenius</i>) is an extinct species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth"><span class="s3">mammoth</span></a> that lived during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene"><span class="s3">Pleistocene</span></a> until its extinction in the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene"><span class="s3">Holocene</span></a> epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammuthus_subplanifrons"><span class="s3"><i>Mammuthus subplanifrons</i></span></a> in the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene"><span class="s3">Pliocene</span></a>. The woolly mammoth diverged from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe_mammoth"><span class="s3">steppe mammoth</span></a> about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"><span class="s3">Asian elephant</span></a>. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory"><span class="s3">prehistoric</span></a> animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia"><span class="s3">Siberia</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"><span class="s3">Alaska</span></a>, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting"><span class="s3">cave paintings</span></a>. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_creature"><span class="s3">legendary creatures</span></a>. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier"><span class="s3">Georges Cuvier</span></a> in 1796.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant"><span class="s3">African elephants</span></a>. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4 m (8.9 and 11.2 ft) and weighed up to 6 metric tons (6.6 short tons). Females reached 2.6–2.9 m (8.5–9.5 ft) in shoulder heights and weighed up to 4 metric tons (4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period"><span class="s3">last ice age</span></a>. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_(animal)"><span class="s3">coat</span></a> varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite"><span class="s3">frostbite</span></a> and heat loss. It had long, curved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusk"><span class="s3">tusks</span></a> and four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"><span class="s3">molars</span></a>, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae"><span class="s3">sedges</span></a>. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe"><span class="s3">mammoth steppe</span></a>, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America. &lt;body&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul_Island_(Alaska)"><span class="s3">St. Paul Island</span></a> until 5,600 years ago and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangel_Island"><span class="s3">Wrangel Island</span></a> until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory"><span class="s3">ivory</span></a> as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project"><span class="s3">genome project</span></a> for the mammoth completed in 2015,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth#cite_note-genome_2015-1"><span class="s4"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a> it has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, but none of these are yet feasible. &lt;html&gt;</span></p>
